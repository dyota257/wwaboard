    <title>Update to board on Collin Kerr handover</title>
  </head>
  <body> 
    <p>Hi all,</p>
    <p>I met with Collin on Sunday night to talk about the duties that he'll be stepping back from.</p><b>On the graphic design side</b>
    <p>He kindly gave me notes which I've typed up here. These can be passed on to a future graphic designer. All the graphics design assets for the next tournament have been p created.</p>
    <p>In terms of assets, he's got a folder of WWA tournament photos that he's been using to create posters. He will share that collection. He's also happy to share the raw p working image files that another graphic designer could run with. I'll follow up with him on the handover of those files.</p><b>On the website</b>
    <p>Collin's already given me management access into website, so I can maintain the website. The first task for me to do will be post-tournament results for August.</p>
    <p>He says that out of website, graphic design, and social media, the most time-consuming part is the graphic design. </p><b>On social media</b>
    <p>He says he's happy to do social media posts leading up to the tournament itself (registration reminders etc). I suppose Admin and Co will take over after this.</p>
    <p>On a successor (my own thoughts)</p>
    <p>The website and social media are hand-over-able.</p>
    <p>The graphic design is not so much. Adobe PhotoShop is not for casuals, and the work he produces looks professional. He also has the diligence to create different versions p for different screen sizes and use cases.</p>
    <p>He has so far produced three posters featuring members of our wrestling community. If we had one more, so that we had four distinct posters for the four tournaments we have a year, that would be good to cover us. We can then re-use the posters and just change the date etc. I think it would be good to find someone to (at least) produce a p poster for the fourth tournament of the year.</p>
    <p>I looked over the Admin and Co proposal, and it doesn't explicitly have graphic design - we are supposed to supply images and graphics.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it's something to include in the next edition of the newsletter, a call out to someone with graphic design skills to help out? </p>
