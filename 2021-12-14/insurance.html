    <blockquote> The Board decided that the most fair method would be via <strong>Pro-rata calculation based on membership numbers</strong>. This method would make the invoice to each state proportionate to the number of members covered in that State.</blockquote>

    <blockquote> Why should the states with the most members be punished for having more members. This will encourage the states to reduce their memberships so their share of the insurance will be reduced. At a previous AGM NSW and Victoria complained (and rightly so) that they were both paying 25% of the premium and the other states paid 12.5%. It was decided to be fair to all the States the split for each state should be <strong>17.5%</strong>  and <strong>12.5%</strong> for ACT until their financial situation improves</blockquote>

    <blockquote>If looking to make it more equitable maybe consider <strong>proportioning it based on state population</strong>. That way it doesnâ€™t penalise states for building their membership base but still. Hopefully supports smaller states like SA/NT/ACT with a smaller potential member pool.</blockquote>
