                    li  It was a very long day for the officials. This would have been alleviated if we had more people offering to referee but this did not occur. If we can't get more officials so that referees can be relieved after the first half of the program, we should revert to the previous system of having one tournament , mixing junior and senior matches. 

                    li  All affiliated clubs should be forced to provide referees at tournaments for the entire duration . If they don't, the club will not be entitled to any points regarding annual awards. The club will also not be announced at the opening ceremony. The club's wrestlers are free to compete but they will attend as independents.  This way we are not penalising the wrestlers but making it clear that clubs must provide referees as well as wrestlers . 

                    li An incentive should be offered to referees that attend all tournaments held by WWA for the calendar year  . I suggest a Myer gift voucher of $100. This way we acknowledge and reward people that fully support WWA tournaments by acting as referees.
