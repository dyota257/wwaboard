    <h3>* On-tournament fundraising</h3>
    <p>If people come to the tournament with a table asking for fundraising, we can support that on the day? Check Herb Graham policy. Rick thinks: fundraising policy and procedure, for consistency.</p>
    <h3>* WWA board nominations</h3>
    <h3>* Membership trial period</h3>
    <p>At some clubs, participants are required to sign up with the association before engaging on the mat for insurance purposes. Also, a "trial" period may encourage more signups if there is less of a commitment cost. </p>

    <p>Don't delete footage of matches - there's plenty of room and battery. Footage is important for complaints. Have the same policy as scoresheets - keep until next tournament.</p>
