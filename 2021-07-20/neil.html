      br > Hi,
      br >     Just for future reference following the deliberate eye gouging to Karen today apparently condoned by Coach Landy and br Gladiators wrestling.
      br >     I want to put it on the record that TRUTH won't have players participating in special/exhibition matches concerning br Gladiators in light of the win at all costs and thug like culture.
      br >    We teach respect and good sportsmanship. Not using kids to try to settle scores and encouraging kids to hurt other br kids is just a McDojo warning sign.
      br >      BASED will make a decision concerning the willingness to support any future WWA events however the priority of br paperwork over safety is not a good sign. Unfortunately I have no positive comments to make concerning this event and the br way we were approached to assist.
